# powerranger

A [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)-inspired file manager for PowerShell.

## Installation

You'll need Python 3.7 or higher. Install or update with:

```shell
pip install --user --upgrade powerranger
```

## Usage

Run from a console with:

```shell
powerranger
```

Or:

```shell
python -m powerranger
```

If you want to run inside of `mintty`, the terminal emulator which ships with
Git Bash, and get a message saying "Rediration not supported", you will need
to prepend the command with `winpty` to start the program instead:

```shell
winpty powerranger
```
